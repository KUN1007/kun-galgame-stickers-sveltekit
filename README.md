## Introduction

KUN Visual Novel Stickers is a subsite of the KUN Visual Novel Forum, dedicated to collecting sticker packs. It does not adhere to the operating principles of the forum.

Currently, the number of stickers on this website has exceeded 400!

These are stickers captured from various visualnovels, with the purpose of

* Recommending fun and cute games to more people through stickers
* Moe!

In the future, some SD_CG and CG screenshots from games may be updated as stickers. Currently, there are only pure expressions of characters from the games, and of course, you can also join our group at the end of the article.

## Standards

This series of sticker packs tries to follow these standards as much as possible

* All are Visual Novel (galgame) stickers, excluding anime, comics, illustrations, etc.
Square screenshots
* Try to capture the character's ahoge completely
* Mainly small, cute, soft-moe, ~~and fluffy white-haired lass characters~~

Some stickers do not follow these standards because they were captured too early

## FAQ

Q: Will these stickers be continuously updated?

A: Of course. I will capture stickers while playing games, which means as long as I'm still playing visualnovels, there will definitely be updates.

Q: Can I contribute stickers to this series?

A: Certainly! If you are familiar with using GitHub, you can submit a PR to us, placing your own stickers in the Others folder under your own named folder. You can also join the visualnovel discussion group below to share your stickers in the group.

Q: Why is the image format of the first set of stickers different?

A: Some were directly transferred from QQ because I had not started collecting these stickers specifically before. All stickers updated in the future will be in PNG format.

Q: Why are there only expressions of one person from many games in the entire game?

A: I am a one-route warrior
