// editorPackVariant is what a picker grid renders. 320 is the same variant the

const editorPackVariant = "320"

// EditorPacks is the whole official sticker catalogue in one response, shaped
// for a sticker picker.
//
// It exists because every editor in the ecosystem shipped its own copy of the
// same 498 URLs, generated from `KUNgal{set}/{n}.webp` with a hardcoded set of
// pack sizes -- forum, moyu and this site each had one, all of them dead the
// day this host stopped serving static files, and all of them silently wrong
// long before that (a pack gained stickers; the arrays did not).
//
// Two shape decisions:
//
//   - ONE request, not the face's list-then-fetch-each. A picker needs every
//     sticker of every pack at once, and 1+N round trips to build one panel is
//     the sort of thing consumers work around by hardcoding again.
//   - `src` is the CDN URL, and it is what the picker INSERTS INTO POST
//     CONTENT. That is the actual fix for the class of bug: the old path
//     encoded a position in a mutable collection, so years of posts rotted
//     when the collection moved. A content hash encodes the bytes and cannot.
//     The corollary is a rule for this site, not for consumers: official
//     stickers are retired by status, never hard-deleted, or the image
//     service's refcount drops to zero and the old posts break anyway.
//
// Official packs only. A picker offered in someone else's editor is not the
// place to surface unmoderated user uploads.
